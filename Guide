App Description
    • Upon opening, the application will display a login page.
    • Users can create an account from the login page. By default, a new account is created as a client account. To create an admin account, select 'admin' during the account creation process.
    
    • Testing: Open two browser windows, one logged in as an admin and the other as a client. Editing from the admin account will notify the client if they subscribe to the team.
